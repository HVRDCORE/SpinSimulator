# Spin&Go Poker Simulator

A high-performance C++ Spin&Go poker simulator with Python bindings for reinforcement learning and tree traversal algorithms.

## Features

- Fast C++ core implementation of Texas Hold'em rules for Spin&Go tournaments
- Python bindings for easy integration with machine learning frameworks
- Support for reinforcement learning (RL) with Ray/RLlib
- Implementation of tree traversal algorithms (MCCFR, Deep CFR)
- Optimized hand evaluation and game state representation
- Comprehensive unit tests and benchmarks

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 8+, Clang 6+, or MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.10+
- Python 3.8+
- pybind11
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 2.x (for Deep CFR)
- Ray/RLlib (for RL examples)

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poker-simulator.git
